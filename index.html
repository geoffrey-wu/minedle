            <p>Wordle-Themed Minesweeper: Minedle.</p>
            <p>Guess the minesweeper puzzle in as few tries as possible.</p>
            <p>
                Each try you have to guess all the locations of the mines.
                If you dont get it spot on, then they take the locations you guess and act as if they're clicking them in the actual minesweeper puzzle.
            </p>
            <p>
                So if you hit a mine, it tells you that's the correct location of a mine.
                If not, it does a regular minesweeper click and reveals that information.
